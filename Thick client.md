## THICK CLIENT

  -  A thick client, also known as a fat client or rich client, is a type of application architecture that involves a significant amount of processing on the client side. Unlike thin clients, which rely heavily on server-side processing, thick clients perform a substantial portion of the application logic and data processing on the user's device.

### A)  Identify the Application architecture, languages, and frameworks used. ? 

  -  Common Architectures of Thick Client applications are **Two-Tier** and **Three-Tier**,
  -  **Two-Tier architecture**:   In two-tier architecture, the thick client application implements client-to-server communication. The application is installed on the client computer and, in order to work, will need to communicate with a database server. For example, imagine an HR application that was installed on the client computer and, in order to retrieve the employeesâ€™ information, communicates directly with the HR database server.

  -  **Three-Tier architecture**:  In three-tier architecture, the client communicates with an application server, which in turn talks to the database in a manner similar to a regular web application. The most common communication method in these applications may be carried out using HTTP/HTTPS. Three-tier architecture has a security advantage over two-tier architecture, because it prevents the end-user from communicating directly with the database server.

### B)	Decompile and try to retrieve the source code of the application. Also, check if any hardcoded sensitive information is found.?

  -  Now go to the Admin.cs file. We will see the code that the application is using to upload the data through FTP.

  -  It contains the IP address of the FTP server as well as the credentials.

### C)	 Sniff the traffic between client and server. Identify which protocol is being used for communication.?

  - We used the Wireshark tool to sniff the network between the client and server in the DVTA application

### D)  4.	Identify if unencrypted communication is happening between client and server.?
